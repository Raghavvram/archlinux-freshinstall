To rebuild GRUB on Arch Linux, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

This command generates a new GRUB configuration file and saves it to the specified location. Make sure you have `grub` installed and configured correctly. If you're facing issues with GRUB, let me know, and I can guide you further!
